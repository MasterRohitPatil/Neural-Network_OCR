# Neural-Network_OCR
This was an Amazing workshop conducted by IEEE sies gst, focuses on the core principle of machine learning.Here we used concepts of basic math used in computing a nueron for classifying 10 digit for a fully connected neural netowrk

## Single Neuron output 
neuron output = (input*weight)+bias
